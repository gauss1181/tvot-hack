NextWatch
=========
NextWatch is an iOS mobile web app that allows you to build a TV watcher profile and track stats of previous TV shows/movies that you've watched, based on things like the names of the shows/movies, genres, running time, featured actors/actresses, and directors of the shows/movies. It can also help you generate suggestions on what to watch next on a certain day/time, based on your historical TV watching history, and also suggest friends with whom you could watch your next TV show/movie with on whatever days/times of your choice.

Created at TVOT Hack 2014 in San Francisco, June 7-8.
Collaborators: Shaohan Chen, Ray Kung
